## Twitter-Trump Sentiment-Analysis Using Python 

### Tweepy package from Python has been used to extract the tweets on Trump. The intuition is to understand how the tweeps are reacting to Trump based on his recent speeches and what are their sentiments around their tweets. 

#### The .ipynb notebook will take you on my journey in setting up the Twitter developer credentials [though I have hidden the credentials for privacy concerns]. The setup is relatively easy and will take few minutes to start a Twitter API once the credentials are setup. 

#### After setting up the Twitter API, I use Trump as my search_word to extract all the recent tweets with #trump. In my analysis, I have used traditional NLP techniques to uncover the sentiments of tweets for Trump. I have used the last 1000 tweets to generalize my findings. Since this analysis was done on 4 July 2020 and trump is one of the most used hashtag in the world of Twitter, hence majorly the observations are revolving around the news/speeches Trump gave on 3rd and 4th July.

#### The jupyter notebook shows how frequency word analysis, bigram analysis, network analysis of tweets and polarity score based on sentiments of tweets summarize Trump on twitter for the first week of July 2020. In my future works, I would like to add a bigger timeframe and more tweets for my analysis. Also, I would like to include more deep learning methods for the sentiment analysis.
